# cv-app

A basic app that takes user information and displayes it in a CV format (Project idea courtesy of The Odin Project).

Upon opening the app, users will see a form asking for various info (name/contact, education, work experience). Once the form is filled out and submitted, the submitted information will be returned on the right side, formatted into a basic CV.

This small project served as an introduction to React. It was a good opportunity to get a feel for what creating things with React is like. From creating the components to setting up the component states, working on this was an interesting experience that was different from previous coding projects.

Admittedly, I'll say the app is very basic and not for practical use. I concerned myself more with getting the core functionality of taking form data and displaying it over the details and styling of the displayed data. I recognize that improvements could be made such as adding more categories to the form for more user info and improving/adding new styles, but I didn't find myself too interested while working on this project to go above and beyond. Maybe as my skills improve I'll come back to this just to see what more I could've done.
